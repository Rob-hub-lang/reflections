Week 7
Visualization: https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/ 
This visualization shows the number of unique words hip hop rappers have used in their lyrics when compared to each other, only using the first 35,000 lyrics of each artist. The graphs they use to represent the data are simple but very effective in what they are trying to portray. The icons of the faces of each rapper used to represent themselves in the graph helps the viewer to easily identify the hip hop rappers and how many unique lyrics they have. They make good use of a scatter plot and when you hover over the icons, it gives useful information such as the rappers name and number of unique words they have used. One critique I would have about this visual is that it is somewhat bland as it only uses shades of gray to represent the graph, however this could have been intentionally made this way. My preference would be to incorporate additional colors to the graph to make the visual more lively to help represent the creativity behind the lyrics these rappers use in hip hop. The website could have also used colors to represent what era each rapper was in similar to the graph below. This way, the website would not need to use both of these graphs as they are essentially both trying to convey the same thing. I thought that the overlapped bar chart comparing unique lyrics with different genres brought new and interesting information to the website. Showing how different genres use lyrics in their songs. One other issue with the graph is that the dropdown menu to highlight an artist does not work as it was designed to, which would be a technical issue the visual has.
