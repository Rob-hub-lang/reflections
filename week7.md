The graphs in this article shows each candidate's path to the GOP nomination for 2024. Based on which states they’re strongest in, they calculate how many delegates each candidate needs to win to be on pace to win the nomination. Each candidate must receive the majority of their party’s delegates to win the nomination. For Republicans, there are nearly 2,500 delegates, and a candidate needs 1,215 delegates to win the nomination. For Democrats, there are around 3,900 delegates, and 1,969 are needed to win. The candidates are compared using a line graph showing how many delegates need to nominate the candidate in each month. The interactive ability to display information when hovering over a particular point in a candidate's graph is helpful to the user when trying to figure out how many more delegates the candidate needs to be nominated. On the right hand side of the graph, states become highlighted to signify which states have voted for the candidate. This seems very useful as it shows the estimated timeline of events that could happen during each candidate's path to nomination. Also when you hover over a particular spot on the graph, it will then highlight what states they have to win over to be on path for nomination. The keys for being over and under the benchmark are not used in any of the graphs, this could potentially be confusing as it makes the graphs less clear whether a candidate is estimated to be over or under the benchmark for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. The keys might not be appearing because the graphs show what the voting distribution looked like in the past and the voting for GOP nomination in 2024 will start Monday, January 15. Since the GOP nominations for 2024 have yet to start, the graphs are not fully complete but the article does a great job in providing useful information to the viewer and allowing them to follow each candidate's journey daily during their run.

This visualization displays the scale comparisons of different tesla factories. One thing I like about this is the smaller icons of products each factory produces, from Model Y teslas to battery packs and megapacks. One thing that is difficult to visualize is the actual size of each building within the pictures. The visualization includes a compass as well as a reference for miles and kilometers. If I could add something to the visualization, I would add the ability to inspect each building to see a more detailed view of the factories. This would especially be useful in the smaller factories like Giga New York and Mega Factory where it is very difficult to see the images of the factories. The Kato Factory is also so hard to spot that I missed it the first time looking at the visualization. Highlighting the factory or drawing a red circle around the tiny image could help make it stand out more. The icon with its description above seems a little bit unorganized. A way I would fix this is getting rid of the description and when you hover over the icons under each factory, it would then display more information like what type of model tesla the icon is and how many the factory produces per year. Overall I would say that this visualization does a good job when comparing the different sizes of scale for each factory, however the information on each factory could have been handled better.

This Data Visualization shows the current head coaches win percent vs. years being with their team. One thing that I find visually appealing about this graph is the gradient of percentages from lowest (being red) to highest (being blue).  The gradient is also based off of the color scheme where blue is equal to at least one championship in career, yellow equal to 1+ career playoff wins, but no championships, and red being no career playoff wins. The visual also has a bunch of interactive hovering visuals, like hovering over axis titles. Hovering over the trend lines will give the formulas for each trend line, and hovering over a coach will give their individual statistics (career record, team they coached for, career wins, etc.). Another thing I like about this graph is that it has a picture of each coach's face on the scatterplot. This makes the graph much more appealing to interact with and it seems to do a better job than having any other symbol that would represent the coaches. One thing I wish this graph could have included is what year each coach began coaching their team. A feature I would add that I think would be meaningful to this graph is being able to click each coach and see the stats for the previous coach of the team and being able to compare them. Overall, I believe this graph is able to do its job extremely effectively as it is simple to understand, visually appealing, and provides interesting statistics for all the coaches.






















Week 4
Visualization: https://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/ 

This graph displays a simulation of 1,000 people’s average day. It’s based on 2014 data from the American Time Use Survey. Each dot represents a person, the color represents the activity, and time of day is shown in the top left. As someone changes an activity, say from sleep to a morning commute, the dot moves accordingly. I particularly enjoyed the aesthetics and animations of this graph as seeing the dots that represent individuals move from task to task during their day was visually appealing. The graph also gives useful descriptions about the overall activities that are going on during different times as well as the percentage of people participating in each activity, which I think is very helpful for the viewer when looking at the graph in fast mode. Although the graph was visually appealing, it seemed to sacrifice the statistics for an individual's daily schedule for a visual that focuses on a more granular sense of how each person contributes to the overall patterns. Because of this, it's difficult to track a specific person's daily routine in the graph. Also, it appears that some dots get stuck in clusters when trying to move from task to task, making it slightly more difficult in understanding the visualization. One thing I would like to add to this graph is the ability to choose which people can be displayed on the graph, allowing for a better understanding of the daily patterns of activities for things like men between the ages of 20-30, or for people who are married. Overall, I would say that the graph is a unique and effective way to present a more granular sense of the overall daily activities of people and trending patterns.























Week 5
Visualization: https://qz.com/296941/interactive-graphic-every-active-satellite-orbiting-earth 
This visualization shows a very unique style that displays satellites distance from earth. It also has information on how much the satellite weighs, where the satellite is from, and when it was launched. One cool interactive feature of the graph was that when you hovered over a satellite, it would then display information on its age and name as well as visually display how varying distances away from earth the satellite travels. There is also an animation feature on the graph that shows the satellite's path during its orbit around the earth. My favorite design on this graph is that it provides short descriptions and fun facts about the satellites as you continue to scroll down the visualization. This makes the visualization feel like it's telling a story as you continue to explore the website and makes the viewer more interested in what's going on in the visualization. These descriptions can also highlight specific information on the graph so that you can better understand what the description is saying about the satellites and it also provides useful links to other websites that go further in depth. One aspect of this graph that makes it difficult to visualize is the clusters of satellites that are grouped together at certain orbits, making it difficult to view specific satellites. One way to fix this would be having the ability to highlight specific satellites that you want to view and hide the other satellites from view. Although they have different ways to color satellites based on their characteristics, it would also be helpful to hide satellites from view that you are not interested in. Overall, I think this graph was very educational and pretty easy to understand what was going on, however certain parts of the visualization were overcrowded.























Week 6
Visualization: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/20/bussed-out-america-moves-homeless-people-country-study?CMP=twt_gu 
This data visualization shows how the relocation of homeless people has affected America. This paper mostly focuses on the number of homeless people 
within San Francisco and how transporting the homeless people to other places has affected San Francisco. This paper also discusses individual experiences 
of homeless people and how relocation has affected them. The interviews of the experiences of the homeless people really helped the overall understanding 
of what the data was portraying and made the viewer more invested in the message the paper is trying to convey. One aspect I found helpful when viewing 
the paper was that when you viewed a graph, you would scroll through descriptions explaining what the graph displays and what the impact on America and 
homeless people is on the graph. This was helpful because it described what were the most important aspects of the data visualization and also how the 
graph was related to the paper itself. Throughout the paper, they used many animated graphs that showed the journey of homeless people. Another graph that 
used good interactive techniques was a flow like diagram graph showing Homeless Relocations from New York City. The graph was split into 3 separate parts 
that would add on to each other as you continue to observe the graph. First showing the most common foreign countries people were relocated to, then the
most common place, then most common states in America. Overall, I liked the idea of using simple interactive graphs that were used to help when reading 
the paper and the descriptions over the graphs that you would scroll through to help understand the data.






















Week 7
Visualization: https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/ 
This visualization shows the number of unique words hip hop rappers have used in their lyrics when compared to each other, only using the first 35,000 lyrics of each artist. The graphs they use to represent the data are simple but very effective in what they are trying to portray. The icons of the faces of each rapper used to represent themselves in the graph helps the viewer to easily identify the hip hop rappers and how many unique lyrics they have. They make good use of a scatter plot and when you hover over the icons, it gives useful information such as the rappers name and number of unique words they have used. One critique I would have about this visual is that it is somewhat bland as it only uses shades of gray to represent the graph, however this could have been intentionally made this way. My preference would be to incorporate additional colors to the graph to make the visual more lively to help represent the creativity behind the lyrics these rappers use in hip hop. The website could have also used colors to represent what era each rapper was in similar to the graph below. This way, the website would not need to use both of these graphs as they are essentially both trying to convey the same thing. I thought that the overlapped bar chart comparing unique lyrics with different genres brought new and interesting information to the website. Showing how different genres use lyrics in their songs. One other issue with the graph is that the dropdown menu to highlight an artist does not work as it was designed to, which would be a technical issue the visual has.
